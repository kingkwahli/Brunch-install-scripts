# Install scripts for the Brunch project.

Someone else made these, but the are not very optimized and only work for one type. Select the proper .sh file for your device.
Make sure you follow [this guide](https://beebom.com/how-install-chrome-os-on-pc/) or just the instructions from Brunch itself.

### Important! Make just that you double-check that you have the right disk. If your Linux disk does not show up as /dev/sda, edit the .sh file!

-Make sure your recovery.bin file is named appropiately, e.g. zork_recovery.bin

## Pick your script
zinstall.sh is for zork/gumboz recoveries

rinstall.sh is for rammus/shyvana recoveries

hinstall.sh is for hatch/jinlon recoveries

vinstall.sh is for volteer/voxel recoveries

sinstall.sh is for samus recoveries

Run

chmod +x thescriptyoupicked.sh
./thescriptyoupicked.sh
Thanks and enjoy!
